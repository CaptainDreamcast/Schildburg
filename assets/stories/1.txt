Oscar: IT'S JUST THE OLD MAN IN A DRESS!
Linga: Hello, oh heroes. My name is Linga, the first princess of Schildburg. I hope you will take good care of me.
PomPom: I'm PomPom the Pomeranyan and this is Oscar, the bachelor in search of a girlfriend.
Oscar: Are you trying to kill me?
Linga: Hello, Sir PomPom and Sir Oscar. I look forward to our journey.
Oscar: Let's leave, this is too kooky for me.
PomPom: (Are you insane? We're so poor we can't even replace our item bags!)
PomPom: (They've been ripped for months! What's an adventurer without items?)
PomPom: What Oscar meant to say was, "let's leave, castles are too spooky for me!", haha!
Linga: Haha, Sir Oscar is so funny!
PomPom: And strong too! We already hit the level cap, so we are as strong as it gets!
Oscar: If you are going to handwave every unimplemented feature, we're still going to be here tomorrow.
Oscar: Let's get this over with fast, so we can find a REAL princess.
Linga: Please lead the way, Sir Oscar.
