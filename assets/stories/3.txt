Oscar: HALT!
Linga: Wh- what is it, Sir Oscar?
Oscar: This is the most dangerous place in the world:
Oscar: A bridge.
Oscar: Whenever a bridge can't be avoided, terrible things happen on it.
PomPom: Usually a cutscene. And no matter how strong we are, cutscenes can end us instantly.
Linga: How terrible! What are we going to do?
Oscar: We'll rest here for the night. If we spend enough time here, there won't be a cutscene on the bridge.
Oscar: This is how you survive in this world.
Linga: Oh, Sir Oscar!
[
Linga: The night sky is so beautiful!
Linga: You see, before my mother died, we often went out and looked at the stars together like this.
Oscar: Can we skip this?
Linga: Sir Oscar, your caring heart moves me, but I feel I have become strong enough to face my fears.
Oscar: We travelled for, like, five minutes.
Linga: Please don't hesitate to share your woes with me. I am no longer the spoiled princess you know.
Oscar: Why are all the monsters old men in bikinis? What's wrong with this place?
Linga: I feel a connection with you. Maybe... maybe it's fate.
Oscar: PomPom handcuffed us together when I wasn't looking.
Linga: I don't mean to pry, but is there a reason you keep me at an arm's distance?
Linga: It's not just me, but PomPom as well. Is there something gnawing at you?
Oscar: None of your business. I'm not some girl who talks about her feelings 24/7, okay? 
Linga: Please know that whichever secret you have, I will always accept you the same way you accepted me.
Oscar: ... Tsk.
Oscar: (No, he's still a 60-years-old man in a dress. I can't let down my guard.)

PomPom: Oscar, wake up! Linga is gone!
Oscar: HECK YEAH!
PomPom: There was only a note left behind: "I shall take the princess' beauty for myself. Signed, The Witch".
PomPom: Who could have taken her?
Oscar: We will never know.
PomPom: Oscar...
Oscar: ...
Oscar: Argh, okay. We ARE heroes after all. It's not like we're saving her because I like her.
PomPom: I never said that, I only whispered that into your ear while you were sleeping over and over again.
Oscar: Then it's settled, off to the Witch's tower!
PomPom: ... Where?
Oscar: ... to the north-west!
