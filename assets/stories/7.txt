Witch: My HP have run out that means I am either dead or incapable to keep on fighting.
Oscar: Thank the Gods the mankini stayed in place.
Linga: Mankini?
Witch: I only wanted to be young again so my ex-husband takes me back.
Witch: He even keeps me from seeing my daughter. She would be around your age now.
Witch: She even has the same name. And dress. And voice. 
Linga: It cannot be...
Linga: What a coincidence!
Witch: Yeah.
Oscar: You're "mother" and "daughter", get on with it!
Linga: M- mom!
Witch: L- Linga!
PomPom: I'm moved to tears, I'm sure we'll get a money bonus for that.
Witch: How will I ever be able to thank you for bringing my daughter to me?
PomPom: Money.
Oscar: Hypnospell for-
PomPom: PG-13!
Witch: You have my heartfelt thanks.
Linga: Oscar... I LOVE YOU!
Oscar: Linga, you're nice and all, but I'm just not into old men.
Witch: Yes, I can see you have been cursed by a powerful being. You're drooping with miasma.
Witch: Right now, every women you see looks like her father, am I right?
Oscar: ... eh?
Witch: It's a temporary curse. A month or two and things are back to normal.
Oscar: ... eh? ... eh? ... eh?
Witch: Then you can see my daughters (and my) gigantic bookshelves again.
Linga: Looks like my feelings will not be reprocicated. At least I had the courage to say it.
Oscar: WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, I just realized my feelings for you!
PomPom: (Oscars's scum!)
Linga: Really?
Oscar: With the old-man-barrier out of the way, nothing can get in the way of our fate together!
Oscar: Here, I'll even tell you my own secret:
Oscar: I'm a girl!
Linga: ... eh?
Witch: ... eh?
PomPom: I knew, but still eh.
Linga: Ah, that's a bit... you know I'm not really...
Oscar: C'mon, let's go see the stars! it'll be great, trust me!
Linga: Waaaahhhh-
Witch: Ah, to be young and in love again.
PomPom: Where is *my* character development?
(
???: Humans are beings that cling to hope.
???: In that way, humans and heroes are similar.
???: Maybe all humans have the potential to become heroes.
???: ...
???: What do you mean heroes are human too?
PomPom: Argh, to me they all look the same anyway.
PomPom: Anyway, thanks for playing!
PomPom: See you next time!
