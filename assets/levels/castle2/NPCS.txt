Hello traveler!
I am waiting for my beloved niece to arrive with a hero and a pomeranyan like you!
She loves to see stars, so I have reserved backstage tickets for her favorite folk music band.
I sure hope she wasn't kidnapped or anything, I'd have to behead the person responsible!

P- please stand in front of me.
I'm a king and want to be treated like one.
Don't be like my ex-wife.

Welcome to Schwertburg, the strongest nation under the sun.
Unless there's the molemen, but they wouldn't count now, would they?
There's a rumor the earth is actually hollow and flat, who knows what's up with that.
N- Not that I believe that. You can have a flyer about it if you want though.
